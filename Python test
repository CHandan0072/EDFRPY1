# Question 1a: Define ETStudent class
class ETStudent:
    # Constructor to initialize student name and id
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):
        self.name = name
        self.student_id = student_id

# Question 1b: Method to display student info with prefix
    def Student_display(self):
        prefix = 'QCC-ET-'
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Id: {prefix}{self.student_id}")

# Question 1c: Create an instance and display info
# Creating object with example values
student1 = ETStudent("Your Name", 987654)

# Calling the display method
student1.Student_display()

# Question 5: Request email input, write to file, print to console

# Ask user for their QCC email
email = input("Enter your email address: ")

# Print to console with prefix
print(f"QCC EMAIL: {email}")

# Write the email to a text file
with open("email.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"QCC EMAIL: {email}")

print(f"\n('QCC EMAIL: {email}' also has been written to the email.txt)")

In Python, instantiate means creating a real object from a class.
When you instantiate a class, you are using its structure to build an actual working object in memory.
For example, student1 = ETStudent("John", 123) is instantiating the class ETStudent with name and ID.

A local variable is declared inside a function and can only be used within that function.
A global variable is defined outside of all functions and can be accessed by any part of the code.
If you want to change a global variable inside a function, you need to use the global keyword.
